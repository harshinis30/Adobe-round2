Transportation : The region is well-connected by an extensive network of trains, buses, and flights. Renting a car is also a great option for exploring the countryside and smaller towns. Language : While French is the o\ufb03cial language, English is widely spoken in tourist areas. Learning a few basic French phrases can enhance your travel experience."

Unlike Spanish bullfighting, the objective is not to harm the bull but to remove ribbons and other decorations from its horns. The razeteurs, or participants, demonstrate agility and bravery as they dodge the bull's charges. The sport is deeply rooted in local culture and is often accompanied by music and festivities, particularly in Arles from April to October."
